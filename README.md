# Tracing Fan Uptakes
This repository demonstrates the different methods for tracing fan genres, responses to the original text, and patterns using data collected from [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/), a fanfiction publishing platform.

This repository is the published code for my article "Tracing Fan Uptakes: Tagging, Language, and Ideological Practices in <em>The Legend of Korra Fanfictions</em>." This article will be published in the upcoming volume of <em><a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/jwa/">The Journal of Writing Analytics</a></em> in December 2020.
