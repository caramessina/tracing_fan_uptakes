# Tracing Fan Uptakes
This repository demonstrates the different methods for tracing fan genres, responses to the original text, and patterns using data collected from [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/), a fanfiction publishing platform.

This repository is currently under construction, but is published for an article under review at <em>The Journal of Writing Analytics</em>.
